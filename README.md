**Purpose**: 
  This tool allows users who work with Bates-stamped documents to easily and quickly create a comprehensive list of Bates ranges for a given set of documents. 

**Background**: 
  Bates stamping is the process of applying a set of identifying numbers to a document collection of PDFs to label and identify them. For example, Disch Inc. might Bates stamp the first page of a confidential file to be used in litigation as DISCH000001. If this document was, for example, 5 pages, the second page would be Bates stamped as DISCH000002, and so on. The process of Bates stamping provides identification, protection, and automatic consecutive numbering of the images.
  
  In economic consulting, when an expert submits written testimony, that expert must list out all documents that were reviewed and relied upon in conducting an analysis. Often, there are several hundred (or even several hundred thousand) Bates stamped files for the expert and their team to review.
